# http4k-rest-example

An opinionated take on how to build REST services.

Key components:

* http4k with Netty as engine and Jackson for JSON serialization
* Exposed used as SQL DSL
* Spek for writing test with Mockito for mocking

The example project can be used as a starting for building REST services. The code contains a controller for service status and another controller for an imaginary user API.
